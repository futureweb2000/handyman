Drywall is a large part of nearly every home and business today, and yet it is something that most people know very little about. This article will review the both basics of drywall and its many uses in today's world – including drywall texture and drywall finish – and the most common questions relating to drywall repair. While drywall is often easily overlooked, one hole in need of drywall repair can completely ruin a room's appearance by drawing attention to the problem area. The same thing goes for a drywall finish that was not done correctly, creating a real eyesore. And reversely, a well done drywall texture can add both depth and balance to a room. Drywall is a common manufactured building material used globally for the finish construction of interior walls and ceilings. A drywall panel is made of a paper liner wrapped around an inner core made primarily from gypsum plaster. The plaster is mixed with fiber (typically paper and/or fiberglass), foaming agent, various additives that increase mildew and fire resistance, and water and is then formed by sandwiching a core of wet gypsum between two sheets of heavy paper or fiberglass mats. When the core sets and is dried, the sandwich becomes rigid and strong enough for use as a building material.
