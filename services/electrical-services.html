							Electrical jobs can be dangerous if not given undivided attention. Before beginning any job, turn the power off at the circuit breaker and tape a note to let people know not to touch it. Wear rubber-soled shoes, stand on a rubber mat or use fiberglass ladders whenever possible. Determine which type of light fixture works best for the space. Next, research and select the proper light bulb to use. Although choosing a light bulb may seem simple, there is a rather endless variety from which to choose. Fluorescent light fixtures have light tubes. These are powered by ballasts. Ballasts are high voltage, outputting 600 volts and up. Exercise great caution to avoid shock. Next, consider the ease of the light switch. Walking across a dark room to turn the light switch on for the light fixture would be less than ideal. Dimmer switches are easy to install over a regular light switch, just make sure that you aren't also trying to control a ceiling fan with a dimmer. Generally speaking, ceiling fans use the same amount of electricity as ceiling light fixtures. Ceiling fans are usually installed in the center of a room for good air flow. In addition to décor, room size and ceiling height determine the size and number of fans to install. It is good practice to make sure the ceiling fan doesn't overload circuits. A useful tip when working on electrical jobs, especially outlets, is to make sure each wire is marked to coordinate with its input location. Process of elimination is a frustrating and dangerous way to match up wires with inputs. Replacing light fixtures, changing light bulbs and installing a dimmer switch are simple enough if the proper safety precautions are taken. However, high voltage jobs, such as replacing the ballast or complex jobs like installing ceiling fans, are sometimes better left to a professional. Handyman Matters has the expertise to handle all electrical jobs while maintaining excellent safety standards for anyone involved in the project. In addition, Handyman Matters can complete the job properly to avoid dangerous hazards that improper electrical jobs will cause in the future.
